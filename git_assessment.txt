What is the difference between Git and Github
	Git is the version control system for your repos. Github is an online site to 		backup or collaborate git repos.

How does Git work?
	Files go through stages, unstaged, staged, or committed. Once committed, they are 	part of the new revision. 

What is a Git repository?
	It’s a collection of revisions to a document, piece of code, or other digital 		project.

- `git push origin master`

- `git remote -v`
